## Task 14: DATE: 07-02-2025


- **Inheritance**: A subclass inherits the attributes and methods of a parent class.
- **Single Level Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one parent class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A chain of inheritance where a class inherits from another subclass.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class.
- **Key Features**: Code reuse, method overriding, extensibility, and maintainability.
- **Method Overriding**: A subclass defines a method that overrides a method in the parent class.
- **Constructor Inheritance**: Subclasses can call the constructor of the parent class using `super()`.
- **Polymorphism**: A subclass object can be treated as an instance of its parent class, with the correct method being called based on the actual object type.
- **Access Modifiers**: Control the visibility of class members in inheritance (`public`, `private`, `protected`, and default).

-**Encapsulation**: Ensure all sensitive fields are private and accessed through well-defined getter and setter methods. Include validation logic where applicable.<br>
-**Polymorphism**: Use abstract class references or interface references to handle objects of multiple types dynamically.<br>
-**Abstract Classes**: Use them to define a common structure and behavior while deferring specific details to subclasses.<br>
-**Interfaces**: Use them to define additional capabilities or contracts that are not tied to the class hierarchy.<br>

## Task 16: DATE: 11-02-2025

**Singly Linked List**: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Traversal is only possible in one direction.<br>
**Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. Traversal is possible in both directions.<br>
**Circular Linked List**: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, creating a loop. Traversal can continue indefinitely.<br>
<br><br>
**Head & Tail Management**: Always maintain the head (and tail in doubly and circular lists) to avoid traversing the entire list when accessing the first or last elements.<br>
**Null Checks**: Before performing operations like deletion or traversal, check if the list is empty to prevent errors.<br>
**Efficient Insertion/Deletion**: Insert at the beginning or end for O(1) time complexity. For operations in the middle, ensure proper pointer updates to maintain list integrity.<br>
**Memory Management**: Properly nullify pointers (next, prev) when deleting nodes to prevent memory leaks, especially in languages without garbage collection.<br>
**Boundary Handling**: Carefully handle edge cases like inserting/deleting at the head, tail, or middle of the list, ensuring correct pointer updates.<br>
**Avoid Infinite Loops (Circular Lists)**: Implement conditions to stop traversal after one complete cycle to avoid infinite loops.<br>

## Task 17: DATE: 13-02-2025
**Stack**

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The element inserted last is the first to be removed. It is commonly used for scenarios where elements need to be processed in reverse order of their insertion.<br>
Key Operations<br>
push(E e): Adds an element to the top of the stack.<br>
pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.<br>
peek(): Retrieves the top element without removing it.<br>
isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.<br>

**Queues**

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the element added first is the first one to be removed. It is widely used in scenarios like scheduling, buffering, and resource management.<br>
Types of Queues<br>
Simple Queue: FIFO behavior.<br>
PriorityQueue: Elements are ordered based on priority.<br>
Deque (Double-Ended Queue): Allows insertion and deletion from both ends.<br><br>
Key Operations<br>
offer(E e): Adds an element to the queue.<br>
poll(): Retrieves and removes the head of the queue.<br>
peek(): Retrieves the head without removing it.<br>
isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.<br>

**HashMap**

A HashMap in Java is a part of the java.util package and is used to store key-value pairs. It provides constant-time performance for most operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval (in the average case).<br>
Key Operations<br>
put(K key, V value): Inserts or updates a key-value pair.<br>
get(Object key): Retrieves the value for a given key.<br>
containsKey(Object key): Checks if a key exists.<br>
remove(Object key): Removes a key-value pair.<br>

## Task 18: DATE: 14-02-2025

**Bubble Sort**
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

**Insertion Sort**
Insertion Sort works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time by picking an element and inserting it at the correct position within the sorted portion.

**Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)**
Merge Sort follows the Divide and Conquer approach, where an array is recursively divided into two halves, sorted individually, and merged back together.

**Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer)**
Quick Sort is another Divide and Conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around it, and recursively sorts the left and right sub-arrays.
